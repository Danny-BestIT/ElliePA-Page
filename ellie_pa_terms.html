  <h1>Ellie PA — Terms of Service & Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 1st, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Legal Entity:</strong> Copy-paste Best-IT LTD | Company No. 515804052 | Registered in Israel</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Ellie PA - a smart assistant that analyzes WhatsApp group messages and provides summaries and insights to help users stay informed. By accessing or using the service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “You”) and Copy-paste Best-IT LTD (“Company”, “We”, “Us”). These Terms apply to both individual users and business entities, unless stated otherwise.</p>

  <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
  <p>Ellie PA connects to WhatsApp groups by being added as a participant by the group’s administrators. The bot has no access rights beyond those of a regular group member: it can read messages, send messages, and view participants and admins.</p>
  <p>Ellie PA processes this data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate daily summaries</li>
    <li>Respond to user queries</li>
    <li>Provide contextual insights based on past conversations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Data is transmitted to third-party services for processing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI - for text analysis and summarization</li>
    <li>Supabase - for database storage (Frankfurt, Zurich, or Stockholm)</li>
    <li>DigitalOcean – for private server execution (Frankfurt, Germany)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Company relies on these providers under their publicly available terms of service and security certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001). The Company does not maintain separate agreements with them and makes no warranties on their behalf.</p>

  <h2>3. Free Trial and Subscription</h2>
  <p>New users are eligible for a 14-day free trial.</p>
  <p>After the trial, access requires a monthly subscription:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic: $9/month</li>
    <li>Advanced: $19/month</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Prices and plan types are subject to change with prior notice. No refunds are provided for monthly payments.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Ownership and Use</h2>
  <p>Message data is stored for 1 to 36 months depending on the subscription tier. Summaries are stored indefinitely unless requested for deletion.</p>
  <p>Group admins can request a full export or deletion of group-related data by contacting support. Raw data belongs to the customer and can be deleted upon request.</p>
  <p>The User grants the Company a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, process, and derive works from the input data, solely for operating and improving the Service.</p>
  <p>All AI-generated outputs (summaries, insights) are the intellectual property of the Company and considered “Derived Works.” Users waive any moral or proprietary claims to such outputs.</p>

  <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>Only group admins can add Ellie PA. By doing so, they confirm they have authority and assume responsibility for notifying members and obtaining consent as required by law. The Company is not responsible for these notices.</p>

  <h2>6. Prohibited Uses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Illegal or unauthorized use</li>
    <li>Infringement on privacy or intellectual property</li>
    <li>Processing data of minors without legal basis</li>
    <li>Uploading unlawful content</li>
    <li>Misuse of WhatsApp or Green API integrations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer – No Professional Advice</h2>
  <p>The Service provides AI-generated information and does not constitute legal, financial, medical, or professional advice. Users are solely responsible for any action taken based on such content. No professional relationship is created with the Company through use of the Service.</p>

  <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>Users agree to indemnify the Company from any claim arising from misuse of the Service, legal violations, third-party rights breaches, or failure to obtain consent from group participants.</p>

  <h2>9. Account Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or delete accounts (with or without notice) for misuse, legal violations, or posting harmful content. This may include permanent deletion of data.</p>

  <h2>10. Security and Access</h2>
  <p>Data is encrypted and secured via third-party providers. Only the Company’s CTO can access raw data. Clients can only access their own data through secure channels.</p>

  <h2>11. Data Protection & GDPR</h2>
  <p>We act as Data Processors under GDPR. We only use GDPR-compliant subprocessors and follow SCCs and DPAs where applicable. Users can request data access or deletion by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>12. Third-Party Dependencies</h2>
  <p>We rely on OpenAI, Supabase, and DigitalOcean. We are not responsible for their uptime, availability, or performance. Temporary service interruptions may occur.</p>

  <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>Total liability is limited to the lesser of $1,000 or 12 months of subscription fees. We are not liable for indirect damages, data loss, or reliance on AI-generated content.</p>

  <h2>14. Disclosure to Authorities</h2>
  <p>We may disclose data if legally required (court order or imminent threat). Where possible, we will notify affected users within 30 days. Such disclosure is not considered a breach.</p>

  <h2>15. Force Majeure</h2>
  <p>We are not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our control, including war, natural disasters, pandemics, and infrastructure outages.</p>

  <h2>16. Assignment and Change of Control</h2>
  <p>We may transfer rights to another entity in the event of merger or acquisition. Users will be notified and may cancel their account within 30 days of the change.</p>

  <h2>17. Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>Disputes under $10,000 must go to binding arbitration in Tel Aviv, Israel. Either party may still seek emergency injunctive relief.</p>

  <h2>18. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These terms are governed by Israeli law. Disputes over $10,000 are handled in the competent courts of Tel Aviv.</p>
